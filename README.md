## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an ongoing project focused on generating Monet-style paintings using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project is currently under construction and aims to create a model capable of generating high-quality Monet-style images.

## Project Setup

- [x] Create a GitHub repository and add `README.md`.
- [x] Set up the environment (install TensorFlow/PyTorch and other dependencies).
- [x] Download and organize the Monet dataset.

## Data Preparation

1. Explore and visualize the dataset.
2. (Optional) Apply data augmentation techniques.
3. Prepare data pipeline for training.

## Model Development

1. Define Generator and Discriminator models.
2. Build and compile models (select appropriate loss functions and optimizers).
3. Implement the GAN training loop (alternate training for Generator and Discriminator).

## Training

1. Train the model on a small subset of the dataset to test the setup.
2. Train the model on the full dataset to generate Monet-style images.
3. Tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

1. Generate 7,000-10,000 Monet-style images.
2. Evaluate image quality both visually and using MiFID metrics.
3. Refine models based on evaluation results.

## Future Work

- Enhance data augmentation strategies.
- Experiment with different GAN architectures.
- Incorporate feedback from evaluations to improve image quality.
