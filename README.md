## Project Overview

Welcome to the **GenerativeAI_Paintings** repository! This project is dedicated to generating Monet-style paintings using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our goal is to develop a model that can create high-quality, Monet-inspired images. The project is currently under development, and we appreciate any contributions or feedback.

## Project Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- [x] Create a GitHub repository and add a `README.md`.
- [x] Set up the environment by installing TensorFlow/PyTorch and other necessary dependencies.
- [x] Download and organize the Monet dataset.

## Data Preparation

1. **Explore and Visualize**: Examine the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Augmentation (Optional)**: Apply techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness.
3. **Prepare Data Pipeline**: Set up a data pipeline to efficiently handle data during training.

## Model Development

1. **Define Models**: Create Generator and Discriminator models for the GAN.
2. **Build and Compile**: Configure models with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
3. **Training Loop**: Implement the GAN training loop, alternating between training the Generator and Discriminator.

## Training

1. **Initial Testing**: Train the model on a small dataset subset to validate the setup.
2. **Full Training**: Train on the complete dataset to generate Monet-style images.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust and optimize hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

## Evaluation

1. **Generate Images**: Create between 7,000 and 10,000 Monet-style images.
2. **Assess Quality**: Evaluate images visually and using MiFID metrics.
3. **Refinement**: Refine and improve models based on evaluation feedback.

## Future Work

- **Data Augmentation**: Explore and implement advanced data augmentation techniques.
- **Architectural Experiments**: Test various GAN architectures to improve results.
- **Feedback Integration**: Use evaluation feedback to further enhance image quality.
