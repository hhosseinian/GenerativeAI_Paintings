# GenerativeAI_Paintings (Ongoing Project Under Construction)
 
Project Setup:

[Done] Create GitHub repository and add README.md.
[Done] Set up environment (install TensorFlow/PyTorch, other dependencies).
[Done] Download and organize Monet dataset.

Data Preparation:

Explore and visualize dataset.
(Optional) Apply data augmentation.
Prepare data pipeline for training.

Model Development:

Define Generator and Discriminator models.
Build and compile models (choose loss functions and optimizers).
Implement GAN training loop (alternate training for Generator and Discriminator).

Training:

Train on a small dataset subset to test setup.
Train on full dataset, generating Monet-style images.
Tune hyperparameters and optimize model.

Evaluation:

Generate 7,000-10,000 Monet-style images.
Evaluate image quality visually and with MiFID.
Refine models based on evaluation results.
